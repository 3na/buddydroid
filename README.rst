Step 1: Install the BuddyPress XML-RPC receiver plugin here: https://github.com/yuttadhammo/buddypress-xmlrpc-receiver 
Step 2: Activate and configure above plugin via wp-admin under Settings->BuddyPress XML-RPC
Step 3: Add your website (root path, e.g. http://www.site.com/), username and password to the Preferences screen in this app, then click register.  Wait for the API key to show up under the API key heading.
